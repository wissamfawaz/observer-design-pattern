# Project Title: Study planner

# Project Description and Usage

This project was made to help its users organize and plan better their deadlines and daily tasks. A notification is sent -if enabled- everyday to remind the users of their upcoming deadlines. It provides a yearly calendar as well as a To-Do list sheet. Moreover, this project is equipped with a Pomodoro clock, so that users can concentrate while having short and long breaks. Finally, a list of relaxing sounds is available to use while studying, to reduce stress (if desired).

# Technologies used

Object-oriented technology is used, where the Observer design pattern was adopted in order to remind users of checking their calendar. This design pattern can create a one-to-many relationships. In the case of this project, whenever a deadline is due soon, the observer who 'observes' the calendar will notify users of their upcoming events.
